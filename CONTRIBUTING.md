# Contributing to Ying

At first I want to thank you for your interest in contributing to Ying.

You should follow these steps in order to make a successful contribution:

1. Install Dart from [this](https://dart.dev/get-dart) website. PS: You don't need flutter in order to run this project.
2. Fork the repository (you can do that on the [repository page](https://github.com/The-Yang-Lang/ying) in the top right corner)
3. Clone the repository to your local filesystem (usually done via `git clone git@github.com:MY-USERNAME/ying.git` - make sure to replace "MY-USERNAME" with your actual username)
4. Make changes to the source code
5. Commit the changes (usually done via `git add .` and `git commit -m "Describe the changes here"`)
6. Push the changes to your fork (usually done via `git push`)
7. Create a pull request (after you have pushed your changes to your fork, Github should show the "Contribute" button)
    1. Make sure that your fork is up-to-date with the latest changes. You can do this quickly via the "Sync fork" button.
8. Give your pull request a meaningful title + description so we can get the gist of your changes without looking into the changes.
9. Wait for feedback
    1. We will comment your pull request if we found something which should be changed
10. Your pull request gets accepted and will be merged into the main repository!
